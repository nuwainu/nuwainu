### How did the project idea appear?

NUWA INU was born thanks to the idea of Elon Musk about creating the first city on Mars. The project team decided to create the first financial system for this city and therefore plans to actively build a dialogue with SpaceX representatives and Elon Musk himself.  

### What is the mission of the project?

The traditional monetary system on planet Earth leads to the impoverishment of the population and the destruction of the entire ecosystem.
We are moving away from this system and starting to build a new one in the first city on Mars. The new financial system of NUWA INU city will be tested on the blockchains of the ERC20, BEP20, MATIC, SOLANA network and will create cross-chain bridges for all degen tokens to combine networks and implement a completely new system based on a deflationary model with an inflationary stablecoin.

### What are the goals of the project?

The NUWA INU project is a pioneer on Mars and aims to build a unique financial system for the first residents of the city.
The NUWA INU project aims to maximize and optimize the development of the city by creating an eco-friendly project with an eco-friendly blockchain using alternative resources for work.
The NUWA INU project aims to combine the benefits of cryptocurrency tools to provide residents of the city with financial stability and independence thanks to a secure and decentralized financial system.

### What tools does the project have?

NUWA INU has a deflationary economy system - each transaction includes a tax on creating a financial safety cushion due to liquidity pools and a percentage of the redemption of tokens and stable coins in circulation using an automated bot system.
NUWA INU has a system of hedge bots - they will favorably affect the exchange rate by buying tokens that are free in circulation and hedging risks from the subsidence of the exchange rate of major currencies by placing margin orders on their dapp platform with the possibility of hedged margin trading.
NUWA INU will have a Dapp platform for exchanging value - each token holder will be able to exchange them and receive interest from commissions that will compensate for market volatility.

### What innovations does the project have in solving problems?

The NUWA INU project offers tools for decentralization and unification of all projects ready to join in order to maximize the power of decentralization and the independence of the financial economy of their projects.
The NUWA INU project offers the correct mathematics of financial economics, where, thanks to the bot system, there are no large sums in the hands of speculative whales, which will allow stable development without a scheme of dumps and pumps.
The NUWA INU project offers a transparent system of financial automated activities, where there will be no human factor.

### What are the prospects of the project?

The NUWA INU project is a pioneer on Mars. The team decided to create the first financial system for a city on this planet and therefore plans to actively build a dialogue with SpaceX representatives and Elon Musk himself.  
The NUWA INU project, upon reaching the number of users over 1 million, will launch its own decentralized blockchain with the ability to create smart contracts for the Internet of private money and services that will be built in the city of NUWA INU.

### What are the prospects of the token?

The NUWA token will be created on a deflationary model, which in the financial system of the NUWA INU project will be constantly burned, bought off by the hedge bot system using smart contracts and sold only for the NUWA INU project's own stablecoin and have an ever-growing rate.
The NUWA token will have protection from listing it on centralized exchanges, thereby excluding the possibility of connecting it to margin trading of centralized exchanges that kill the development of projects due to the rate dump.

### What functions will the token have?

The project will have its own dapp platform for exchange, stacking and farming, where each token money holder can park their tokens and receive INU stablecoins and NUWA tokens.
The NUWA deflationary token will be distributed by stacking money tokens and stablecoins on NUWA INU 's own dapp platform INU inflationary stablecoin will be distributed at the expense of the hold to users of the NUWA token.
In the usual model, these are shares with the distribution of the issue of INU stablecoins as dividends.

### Why does the project need a game?

The mission of the project is the exploration of the planet Mars, the construction of a city. This game will allow everyone to participate in this construction.

### What is the difference from other games?

In addition to the unique idea and gameplay, the game has very global plans:

- Building the company's development in the gaming industry as the main giant and leader
- Creating a powerful team of qualified specialists in the gaming industry, which will develop games in order to increase the liquidity of the company's token economy and the development of its own company's blockchain, on which the company's games will develop.
- Building a metaverse - a parallel platform of habitual life activity with the inclusion of all tools and capabilities that will help create a different, gaming life for participants, game users and the company's token economy.
- NFT is a social network with a mirror image in the form of art objects and realistic avatars of the user, who will be able to immerse themselves in the game universe in order to live and build their life in the gaming virtual space.
